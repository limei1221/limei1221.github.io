title: Derivatives, Gradients, and Jacobians Explained
---

All three of these terms represent the core concept of a **derivative**: measuring how a function's output changes as its input changes. The difference between them simply depends on the *dimensions* of the function's input and output.

Hereâ€™s the simple breakdown:

* **Derivative:** For functions with **one input** and **one output**. (Scalar $\to$ Scalar)
* **Gradient:** For functions with **multiple inputs** and **one output**. (Vector $\to$ Scalar)
* **Jacobian:** For functions with **multiple inputs** and **multiple outputs**. (Vector $\to$ Vector)

## 1. The Derivative

This is the classic derivative you learn first in calculus.

* **Function Type:** Maps one number to one number.
    * $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$
    * Example: $f(x) = x^2$
* **What it is:** A **scalar** (a single number).
* **What it measures:** The **slope of the tangent line** to the function at a specific point. It tells you the instantaneous rate of change (how much $f(x)$ changes for a tiny change in $x$).
* **Notation:** $f'(x)$ or $\frac{df}{dx}$
* **Example:**
    * For the function $f(x) = x^2$, the derivative is $f'(x) = 2x$.
    * At the point $x=3$, the derivative $f'(3) = 2(3) = 6$. This means at this point, the function's output is increasing 6 times as fast as its input.

## 2. The Gradient

The gradient generalizes the derivative to functions that have multiple input variables but still produce a single output.

* **Function Type:** Maps a vector (multiple numbers) to a single number.
    * $\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$
    * Example: $f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2$ (a 3D bowl shape)
* **What it is:** A **vector**.
* **What it measures:** The **direction of steepest ascent**. The gradient is a vector that points in the direction you should move from a point to increase the function's value the fastest. The *magnitude* (length) of this vector tells you how steep that ascent is.
* **Notation:** $\nabla f$ (called "nabla" or "del")
* **How it's built:** It's a vector containing the *partial derivatives* with respect to each input variable.
    * For $f(x, y)$, the gradient is:
        <!-- $$\nabla f = \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \right)$$ -->
        $$
        \nabla f =
        \begin{pmatrix}
        \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \\
        \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}
        \end{pmatrix}
        $$
* **Example:**
    * For the function $f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2$, the gradient is $\nabla f = (2x, 2y)$.
    * At the point $(3, 4)$, the gradient is $\nabla f = (6, 8)$. This vector points directly away from the origin, which is exactly the direction of the steepest climb up the side of the bowl from that point.
* **Key Application:** In machine learning, **gradient descent** uses the *negative* gradient ($-\nabla f$) to find a function's minimum.

## 3. The Jacobian

The Jacobian is the most general form of the three. It handles functions that have both multiple inputs and multiple outputs (i.e., vector-valued functions).

* **Function Type:** Maps an $n$-dimensional vector to an $m$-dimensional vector.
    * $\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$
    * Example: $\mathbf{f}(x, y) = \begin{pmatrix} x^2 - y \\ 2xy \end{pmatrix}$
* **What it is:** A **matrix** (an $m \times n$ grid of numbers).
* **What it measures:** The **best linear approximation** of a vector-valued function at a point. It describes the complex way a small change in the *input vector* causes a change in the *output vector*. Each entry $J_{ij}$ tells you how much the $i$-th output component changes with respect to a tiny change in the $j$-th input component.
* **Notation:** $J$ or $J_{\mathbf{f}}$
* **How it's built:** It's a matrix where each *row* is the gradient (transposed) of one of the output functions.
    * For a function $\mathbf{f}(x, y) = \begin{pmatrix} f_1(x, y) \\ f_2(x, y) \end{pmatrix}$, the $2 \times 2$ Jacobian matrix is:
        $$J = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial y} \\ \frac{\partial f_2}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial f_2}{\partial y} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \nabla f_1^T \\ \nabla f_2^T \end{pmatrix}$$
* **Key Application:** Its determinant (the "Jacobian determinant") is crucial for **changing variables in multidimensional integrals** (like converting from Cartesian $(x,y)$ to polar $(r, \theta)$ coordinates).
